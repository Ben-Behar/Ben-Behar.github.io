The difference in sign is due to the 'handedness' of the system
The difference in the first two columns is due to where the origin is displayed:
 - either the center of the screen (OpenGL)
 - or the corner of the screen (in Class)
if both were converted to the same handedness and relative origin:
 - W = 2*right
 - H = 2*top
 - D = near    
 - F = far
 would produce similar results upon rendering.
